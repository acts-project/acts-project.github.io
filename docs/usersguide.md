## <a name="prerequisites">Prerequisites</a>

Only few dependencies are required to build the Core library of ACTS. A list of
prerequisites required is given below with the version numbers indicating which
versions were tested. Older versions may or may not work, feedback is very
welcome.

The following dependencies are required:

*   A C++14 compatible compiler, e.g. [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org) (>= 6.2) or [clang](http://clang.llvm.org) (>= 4.0)
*   [cmake](https://cmake.org) (>= 3.7)
*   [boost](http://boost.org) (>= 1.62, with `program_options` and `unit_test_framework`)
*   [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) (>= 3.2.9)

The following dependencies are optional and are only needed for some of the
components:

*   [DD4Hep](http://dd4hep.cern.ch) (>= 1.02) for the DD4Hep plugin
*   [doxygen](http://doxygen.org) (>= 1.8.11) for the documentation
*   [graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org) (>= 2.28.00) for the documentation
*   [ROOT](https://root.cern.ch) (>= 6.10.00) for the TGeo plugin

Compatible versions of all dependencies are provided by the [LCG91
Release](http://lcginfo.cern.ch/release/91). This release is also
used in the continous integration system to test the software. A setup script
is provided that can be used to setup the environment on lxplus machines at
CERN

    source CI/setup_lcg91.sh

## <a name="installation">Installation</a>

The ACTS repository is hosted on the GitLab instance at CERN. For the time being
you need to have a full CERN account in order to access the repository. We are
working on a solution for non-CERN users. In order to aquire the latest version
from the git repository you can follow the instructions below.

    git clone https://gitlab.cern.ch/acts/acts-core.git <ACTS_DIR>

## <a name="cmake">CMake build system</a>

CMake is used as build system for compiling and installing ACTS.
For a complete list of cmake options please refer to the [official documentation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.1/index.html) and this nice [list of general cmake options](https://cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_Useful_Variables).
Important options relevant for the ACTS project are given below. They are set by adding '-D\<OPTION\>=\<VALUE\>' to the cmake command.

|option|default|description|
|------|-------|-----------|
|ACTS_BUILD_DOC               | OFF | build documentation |
|ACTS_BUILD_EXAMPLES          | ON  | build examples |
|ACTS_BUILD_TESTS             | ON  | build unit tests |
|ACTS_BUILD_INTEGRATION_TESTS | OFF | build integration tests |
|ACTS_BUILD_DD4HEP_PLUGIN     | OFF | build DD4HEP plugins |
|ACTS_BUILD_MATERIAL_PLUGIN   | ON  | build Material plugins |
|ACTS_BUILD_TGEO_PLUGIN       | OFF | build TGeo plugins |
|CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX         |     | target installation directory |
|CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH            |     | search path for external packages |
|CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER           |     | set C++ compiler (e.g. g++ or clang++) |
|CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE             |     | build type (e.g. Debug, Release) affects compiler flags |
|DD4hep_DIR                   |     | path to the DD4hep installation |

## <a name="build-lxplus">Build ACTS on lxplus</a>

On lxplus the dependencies are provided by a LCG release. You can use the
following commands to build ACTS with all plugins using the same dependency
versions as in the continous integration system.

    source CI/setup_lcg89.sh
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path you want> \
          -DACTS_BUILD_DD4HEP_PLUGIN=ON \
          -DACTS_BUILD_MATERIAL_PLUGIN=on \
          -DACTS_BUILD_TGEO_PLUGIN=ON ..
    make install

## <a name="build-local">Build ACTS on your local machine</a>

Building and running ACTS on your local machine is not offically supported.
However, if you have the necessary prerequisites installed it should be
possible to use it locally. ACTS developers regularly use different
recent Linux distributions and MacOS to build and develop ACTS.

# <a name="using-acts">Using ACTS in your own cmake project</a>

When using ACTS in your own cmake-based project, you need to include the following lines in your `CMakeLists.txt` file:

    find_package (ACTS COMPONENTS comp1 comp2 ...)

where `compX` are the required components from the ACTS project. See the `cmake` output for more information about which components are available.

# <a name="documentation">Documentation</a>

You can find a complete documentation of the ACTS functionality and the class reference guide at [http://acts.web.cern.ch/ACTS/latest/doc/index.html](http://acts.web.cern.ch/ACTS/latest/doc/index.html).
